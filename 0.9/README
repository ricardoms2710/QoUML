This the distribution of BOUML for Unix/Linux/Solaris.
The sources may be compiled under Windows but I do not help you for
this because it is useless : the Windows executable are available on
the BOUML site.

The sources of BOUML itself and the plug-outs written by hand are
placed under the directories 'src'.

The sources of the plug-out generated by BOUML (not written by hand)
are placed under 'genplugouts'.

The projects of the plug-out defined through BOUML are placed under
plugouts. 'empty' is a very important project because you will use
it to define new plug-outs.


To compile BOUML and the plug-outs under Unix/Linux/Solaris :
-------------------------------------------------------------

You must have QT 2.3 or 3.x correctly installed, and 'qmake' because
all the Makefiles except the top one are produced from .pro files

The environment variable QTDIR must be set to the toplevel
directory where Qt is installed.

To compile do 'make'

Installation
------------

By default BOUML and the plug-outs are installed under /usr/lib/bouml,
and a shell script named 'bouml' is placed under /usr/bin. These paths
are specified in the Makefile, change the locations if you want
before doing the installation.

The installation is done through 'make install', after that the current
directory may be removed. To just remove the obj do 'make clean'

'make uninstall' uninstall BOUML
